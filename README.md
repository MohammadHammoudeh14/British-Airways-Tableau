# ✈️ British Airways Customer Experience Analysis (Tableau)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **British Airways customer review data** to understand the key factors influencing passenger satisfaction. Using Tableau, I built an **interactive dashboard** that allows decision-makers to explore performance trends and identify operational and service improvement areas.

## ❗ The Problem  

Airlines receive thousands of customer reviews, but raw feedback alone does not clearly show:

- When customer satisfaction is improving or declining  
- Which countries have poor experiences  
- Whether issues are related to aircraft type, seat class, or service quality  
- Which customer segments (business, leisure, families, etc.) are most affected  
- The root causes behind low ratings (comfort, staff, food, entertainment, etc.)

Without structured analysis, decision-makers struggle to turn customer feedback into actionable improvements.

## 💡 The Solution  

I developed an **interactive Tableau dashboard** that transforms customer reviews into clear, data-driven insights.

The dashboard includes:

- **KPIs** to monitor overall customer satisfaction  
- **Average rating trends by month** to track performance over time  
- **Ratings by country** to identify geographic problem areas  
- **Ratings by aircraft type** to evaluate product quality  
- **Segmentation by seat class and traveller type** to understand different customer expectations  
- **Service category analysis** (comfort, staff, food, entertainment, etc.) to uncover root causes of dissatisfaction  

Users can apply filters and interact with the dashboard to move from high-level performance to detailed diagnostic analysis.

## 🎯 Business Impact  

This dashboard supports **data-driven operational and strategic decisions**, helping airlines:

- Detect service issues early  
- Improve customer experience for specific traveller segments  
- Optimize aircraft usage and cabin offerings  
- Prioritize investments in the areas that most affect customer satisfaction  

It provides a **360° view of customer experience**, answering:  
**When is the issue? Where is it happening? Who is affected? What is causing it?**
